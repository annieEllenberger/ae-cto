# Project Context

This is an Astro site using the Astroship template. Starter template reference: https://astro.build/themes/details/astroship/ 

All code is inside the `site/` directory.

The goal is to create a personal website for Annie Ellenberger, a Fractional CTO & Technology Strategist.
Use the `reference_doc/` directory for reference to the actual content which should be created as a single page app with the navigation links linking to sections on the page.

## Component Guidelines
- All components go in `src/components/`
- Use Tailwind CSS utility classes only
- Follow patterns from existing components (features.astro, pricing.astro)
- Components should be self-contained .astro files
- Use astro-icon for icons when needed

## Styling
- Use Tailwind's default classes
- Common colors: slate-600, slate-700, blue-600
- Spacing: py-16 for sections, mb-8 for spacing
- Keep consistent with existing component styles
